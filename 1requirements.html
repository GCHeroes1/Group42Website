        <p class="text-black-50">A previous IXN MSc project created a chatbot with the aim of improving how GPs can
          access educational material. It was presented to the leading GPs at the RCGP and sparked
          lots of interest! We’d like to continue to develop and build out this chatbot focusing on a
          larger and more complex educational resource.</p>

        <h2 class="text-black mb-4">Requirement gathering</h2>
        <p class="text-black-50">In order to design our application, we held semi-structured interviews with multiple
          end-users (GPs) to see their opinion on the direction the project should take; below is an example of one of
          these interviews that gave us a lot of relevant data points. Unstructured questions that were added during
          the interview are highlighted in blue.
        </p>
        <p class="text-black-50"><b>Q: What are your thoughts on the current system used by the NHS for getting medical
          information and documents?</b></p>
        <p class="text-black-50">A: The current GP system we have just pulls up documents and we search through…
          it works fine but it can take a while looking through all the information because of how big the files are.
        </p>
        <p class="text-black-50"><b>Q: If you could improve the system in some way, what improvement would you make?
        </b></p>
        <p class="text-black-50">A: I’d speed up the process of looking through the documents somehow. Would save GPs
          in my clinic a lot of time.
        </p>
        <p class="text-black-50"><b>Q: Have you used an example of AI before and if so, in what context?</b></p>
        <p class="text-black-50">A: I have an Amazon Alexa at home and I use it for simple things like playing music
          and setting alarms. Sometimes I use it for random questions and facts too.
        </p>
        <p class="text-black-50"><b><mark>Q: So when asking your Alexa these questions on occasion, how do you feel
          about the response you get back? Does it answer your question, and if not how do you react?
        </mark></b></p>
        <p class="text-black-50">A: Usually Alexa will answer the question perfectly, but sometimes she responds
          saying she doesn’t know how to answer. Usually when that happens I just ignore it and search it on my phone
          instead- her answering it is more for convenience so I don’t have to check myself.
        </p>
        <p class="text-black-50"><b>Q: How would you feel about the ability to ask an AI (like Alexa) to get the
          medical information you get from documents in the current NHS system for you?
        </b></p>
        <p class="text-black-50">A: Alexa? (we clarified at this point that the AI was a text based chatbot, not
          speech based) In that case my biggest issue is that I am trusting the AI to return to me the correct answer-
          what if it returns an answer from the wrong document, and because I can’t check it I endanger a patient?
          That would put me off heavily.
        </p>
        <p class="text-black-50"><b><mark>Q: Following on from the issue you highlighted, what if you could see the
          document it took the data from?
        </mark></b></p>
        <p class="text-black-50">A: That would put my mind at ease, I can get to things faster and double check that
          it is from the right source. As long as there is an alternative to search manually, I see it as a win/win.
        </p>
        <p class="text-black-50"><b>Q: Finally, where would you want to find this AI to talk to?</b></p>
        <p class="text-black-50">A: As long as it is accessible to us during appointments at our computer. I work at a
          local clinic so I don’t move from my room much, however GPs in hospitals move around a lot, so to them the
          need to be mobile is important. Maybe as a mobile app for convenience?

        <h2 class="text-black mb-4">Scenarios</h2>
        <p class="text-black-50"><b>Scenario 1:</b></p>
        <p class="text-black-50">
          Harold is a very experienced GP however he still has some gaps in his knowledge especially in regards to
          less medical specific information such as patient safeguarding. He had a potentially vulnerable patient
          coming in to see him and wanted to check that he’d be acting in accordance with the safeguarding protocols
          in place, so he pulled up the chatbot through an IM application on his computer.
        </p>
        <p class="text-black-50">
          He found interacting with an IM interface very intuitive and user friendly. He also preferred the colloquial
          format of talking to an AI much better than having to look through documents to find the same information.
          As the chatbot can be integrated into multiple IM applications, Harold appreciated how easy the application
          was to access within his own IM and that the security of the IM extended to the messages exchanged with the
          chatbot. He was able to gain information from the chatbot and his message exchanges were saved on his IM
          account for him to read later.
        </p>
        <p class="text-black-50"><b>Scenario 2:</b></p>
        <p class="text-black-50">
          Elon is training to be a GP and wants to expand his knowledge on certain medical areas whilst at home to
          help him with his training, however he finds it hard to look through long lists of documents with undescriptive
          titles to try and find the exact information he needs, so he decided to consult our chatbot in order to make
          this process easier.
        </p>
        <p class="text-black-50">
          Through an internet enabled device, he was able to query our chatbot through the online chat interface and
          receive a snapshot of a document, containing the information he was requesting. He was also able to save a
          copy of the full document in case he wishes to find more similar information in the future or to check whether
          the information from the chatbot was in the correct context.
        </p>
        <p class="text-black-50">
          He really liked that he was able to find specific information without necessarily having the knowledge of
          the broader field and document it is contained in. He also found being given the full document to read later
          very helpful.
