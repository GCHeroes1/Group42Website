          <p class="text-black-50">Our chatbot will be powered using the Microsoft Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS), which is an algorithm used to identify the intent behind natural language. The idea behind the use of this algorithm is to analyse natural language and get what exactly a user is asking for.
          </p>

          <p>
            It takes a sentence such as the one below and breaks it down into an intent (what the user wants) and an entity (something the user wants to do things with). We can then create individual functions for each type of user intent. The algorithm is key to allowing users to speak in natural language just as if they were talking to a real person; without it, there would be no way of understanding user speech and it would feel a lot more like a command line application, typing in set responses.

          <h2 class="text-black mb-4">LUIS Setup</h2>
          <p class="text-black mb-4">LUIS first needs to be trained with sample sentences for each type of intent. So, using the previous example, the user intent “Show Projects” can be written in many different ways:</p>
          <p class="text-black-50" style="font-size:20px">
            <i>"Find all projects related to AI"</i><br>
            <i>"List projects that use Artificial Intelligence"</i><br>
            <i>"Can you search for AI projects"</i><br>
            <i>"What projects use Artificial Intelligence?"</i><br>
          </p>
          <p>Our testing consists of passing in a large dataset of these example sentences for each intent, so that LUIS is able to identify an intent for any user message. After testing,
          LUIS should be able to recognise any message sent by a user and it is then up to us to write the code that responds to this request.<br><br>
          When passing in a sentence, a score between 0 and 1 is assigned to how close it matches with each intents:</p>
          <img src="img/LUIS%20Training.png" class="img-thumbnail" alt="" width="1100">
          <p class="text-black mb-4">
            LUIS then gets the intent with the highest score and returns it as the best match. To test our LUIS setup, we passed in test sentences and checked which intent they
            were being mapped to. If the intent returned wasn't the correct one for the sentence, it was considered a test failure, and LUIS needed fixing to accommodate for this.<br><br>
            We will use a sample file of messages to test LUIS consisting of valid and invalid chatbot sentences. For the sentences that failed, we will record them and figure out
            why LUIS isn't matching them.

          <p class="text-black mb-4">
            Over the past few months, we were able to train our chatbot to recognise more than just one intent. It now consists
            of these complete intents supporting a range of functions within the chatbot:
          </p>
          <img src="img/LUIS%20intents.png" class="img-thumbnail" alt="" width="1100">
          <p class="text-black mb-4">
            <br>
            The testing for LUIS was done over a period of time. By debugging our chatbot, every command sent was also saved by LUIS
             for us to review. In the end, we recieved 1419 messages recieved by our LUIS app for us to train using. This ensured that
             our chatbot was able to map as many messages as possible to the correct commands.

        <h2 class="text-black mb-4">IXN Form Parser</h2>
        <p class="text-black mb-4">
          As part of our solution, we developed a parsing program that was able to take IXN forms, in word document format,
          parse them into a list data structure in Python and push them to a database. We did this by accessing the XML
          file encoding behind .docx files. Using this, we were able to isolate the table tags and find the text enclosed
          in this table. We then extracted this text and constructed a tuple of field and value pairs.

      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-12 mx-auto">
        <h2 class="text-black mb-4">Fuzzy String Matching</h2>
        <p class="text-black mb-4">
          To compensate for the fact that people filling out forms may choose to change the spelling of fields, or even
          add their own in, we created an algorithm that correctly mapped fields to the order we had them in our database schema.
          We did this by using a fuzzy string matching algorithm, that compared how close to strings were related.
          <br><br>
          The issue with this was that a lot of times, collisions would occur, in which the same field would be mapped twice, to
          2 different columns of our database schema. To fix this, we had to store the best matches for each column of the table and
          whenever a collision occurred, swap out the field that mapped with the lowest similarity score to its next best alternative. The
          issue with this was that sometimes the alternative swapped out also had already been mapped before. As a result, the algorithm
          needed to resolve this was a complex recursive function that checked everything up to that value in the mapped fields
          each time there was a swap.
