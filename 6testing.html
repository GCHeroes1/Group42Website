                <p class="text-black-50">Our testing strategy involved feeding our chatbot hundreds of messages and then
                checking our LUIS tool to see what intents the messages were being categorised into, this allowed us to
                receive quantifiable information as to how accurate our chatbot was and how helpful and relevant its
                responses were to users. Other testing involved getting users to use our chatbot and give us feedback
                for things they may like to see or improvements that could be made, as well as general feedback for
                the feel of the application across a variety of criteria such as ease of use, helpfulness,
                responsiveness, UI design & user friendliness, colour appeal, functionality, etc.</p>

                 <p class="text-black-50">One of the modules which was tested extensively was the pushFileToServer function
                 in a version of our ixnminer, it was imperative that this function was tested extensively as we would
                 need to be aware of any potential issues that could arise as a result of any user input. If there was
                 any problem which could hinder the users ability to input projects into the database, it would render
                 the functionality of the entire chatbot obsolete as the chatbot is retrieving information from the
                 database constantly. As such, the core functionality of the ixnminer (namely the ability to push
                 files to the database) needed to be perfect. We would supply the miner with valid, invalid and
                 erroneous data to see if it would validate inputs correctly, and also in a way that would prompt for
                 a valid input. This testing was carried out throughout the development as ensuring thorough unit
                 testing of our functions ensured that our code was maintainable, reusable, and reliable. It also
                 allowed for easier debugging as we could ensure that modules were functional and able to identify
                 issues in newly written code as opposed to existing code. </p>

                <p class="text-black-50">Compatibility Testing is a type of Software testing to check whether your
                    software is capable of running on different hardware, operating systems, applications, network
                    environments or Mobile devices.</p>
                <p class="text-black-50">We carried out compatability testing by trying to launch the chatbot on
                several devices with varying operating systems. We only carried out the testing on the chatbot website
                itself as it is not a relevant test for the administration panel for the miner. </p>

                <h2 class="text-black mb-4">User acceptance testing</h2>
                <p class="text-black-50">User acceptance testing was the final stage of testing for our project, this
                would involve getting real users to use our system and see if it met the project requirements. It was
                also important that the average user was able to use the chatbot to its full potential.</p>
                <p class="text-black-50">Through user acceptance testing with Dr Dean Mohamedally and some others on
                our course, we discovered that to the avergae user, it was difficult to determine how to utilise the
                chatbot, they would be asking for help prompts which we did not have setup. Through modification of the
                code it was possible to implement an intent that determined whether the user was requesting help and
                additional knowledge of how to use the chatbot. After implementing this, it was significantly easier
                for the user to acccess key resources. This also provided the benefit of allowing us to gain even more
                test data for our application as it allowed us to gain variants of messages being sent to the chatbot.</p>
                <p class="text-black-50">Other feedback which we have received from users is that they enjoy the look
                of the adaptive cards, they find it easy to process the information displayed. The colour scheme was
                favoured by our users, the ease of messaging the chatbot in their own time and typing fashions was a key
                benefit of the chatbot. The responses were prompt and allowed the user to gain further information if
                requested. Navigation of the chatbot was found to be very simple for users as the buttons were clear, for
                example, the back button was universally recognised across our sample and did not require further
                explanation for its functionality. This intuitivity allowed for the comfortable use of our chatbot.</p>
