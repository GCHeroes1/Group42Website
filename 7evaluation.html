        <p class="text-black-50"> 1 - Project should be searched for based off of 4 different criteria, individuals leading,
          skills and devices used, keywords, and location. Searching for organisations. Able to return all projects by
          any given organisation as long as there are any that exist in the database. Able to search for devices used
          if any project exists that used a given device. Able to search via keywords if any projects contain the given
          keywords mentioned anywhere (description/title for example). Able to find projects based off of location if
          it is mentioned in the address. The search function is aided by LUIS which identifies what the user is searching
          for and the keywords that need to be passed to the query. The relevant data can be sent to the query which
          matches the intent most closely and searches for matching projects. </p>
        <p class="text-black-50"> 2 - A database containing projects which have been submitted using the provided IXN miner,
        this database contains all the information that we could collect from IXN forms and is hosted on azure. This
        database is then queried through the chatbot and information can be retrieved and viewed through dialogues or
        adaptive cards.</p>
        <p class="text-black-50"> 3 - We were first able to push and updated projects to the database using CLI prompts,
        following user feedback, we were able to create an administrator panel which allowed for easier pushing and
        updating of projects. This was created using a tkinter GUI. The panel allows for selection of the IXN form from
        the users local storage, there are a variety of text boxes and prompts to allow the user to add additional
        information about the project and is all pushed to one of the four databases.</p>
        <p class="text-black-50"> 4 - Firstly we display the description and full project title, secondly the contact
        details, thirdly where the project is located, and fourth the skills, data and devices required for the project.
        Each time we search for the project, we create an instance of the project to store the information about it.
        When it is first loaded, it only stores the relevant amount of detail until it is selected. A method is called
        which then calls a search query and gathers the relevant information needed to display it to the user. It goes on
        to display said information. An adaptive card is produced to display the relevant information in a friendly way.</p>
        <p class="text-black-50"> 5 - We were able to integrate LUIS in order to better determine the intent of the
        messages received by the chatbot. This allows a more dynamic feel to the chatbot which is much more usable as
        it doesn't rely on needing a detailed script in order to acquire information from the chatbot. We are able to
        further train our app so that it encompasses an even greater array of messages and more accurately determine
        what the best intent is for the users message so that they can receive the most accurate and relevant information.</p>
        <p class="text-black-50"> 6 - The admin panel provides a means of uploading the forms and parses the forms so that
        they can be uploaded. However it does reject files which are in the incorrect format. There is an OOP approach
        for the panel. As IXN forms are tables, we parse the docx file by using the xml behind it, we care able to
        retrieve a list of the data. We are able to use fuzzy string matching to map the fields of the form to our own
        schema (using a library called fuzzywuzzy). We also match conflicts using a method which finds the best match and
        also another method that checks for duplication and selects the best matching field. </p>
        <p class="text-black-50"> 7 - Local storage is possible by connecting to the database using the supplied
        credentials and downloading it from within MySQL Workbench, this provides a SQL dumps file which can then be
        executed in order to host the database anywhere else, even locally if desired.</p>
        <p class="text-black-50"> 8 - The national database is the main projects database, we have supplied credentials
        which trusted individuals can use to store project data on, this will then act as the national database for the
        entire UK. </p>
        <p class="text-black-50"> 9 - Projects are shown in an adaptive card format. These were designed using
        adaptivecards.io in a way that could allow for information to be displayed in a concise manner which was 
        therefore easy to read. </p>
        <p class="text-black-50"> 10 - Prompted responses on the card so that the user can intuitively click through 
        as well as send messages. The adaptive cards can each be clicked to navigate the sections, alternatively messages
        can also be sent to navigate. </p>
        <p class="text-black-50"> 11 - provide a summary on project partners including address and contact information
        which are all displayed on an adaptive card</p>
        <p class="text-black-50"> 12 - store information on contract and NDA information and its progress. We store
        information on the contract in a timeline including when it was completed and the signatories involved. This
        is similar for the NDA. If a project hasnt been finalised it will be displayed at the bottom. </p>
        <p class="text-black-50"> 13 - Visualisation of the progress of contracts and NDA as they are completed. This
        is done in a timeline format. </p>
        <p class="text-black-50"> 14 - Projects from academic institutions can be inserted with additional data. If this
        information is available, it can be selected and displayed within an adaptive card. The card functionality is
        enabled by storing cards in a "Cards" template. A getter method gets these cards and overwrites the information
        held in the card template with the information found from the databases. Projects which are missing pieces
        of information are not displayed, the option is not given to view data which does not exist. </p>
        <p class="text-black-50"> 15 - Images are added to the adaptive cards which are selected based off of which 
        image would best represent the information being displayed. This includes the logo for the organisation which
        helps the user easily identify the organisation for which the data is being displayed.</p>

        <h2 class="text-black mb-4">Critical evaluation of the project</h2>
        <p>User interface / user experience</p>
        <p class="text-black-50">The feedback that we have received shows that the user experience is pleasant and is nearly ideal for our
        target group. Our UI is intuitive and easy to understand, we have been able to successfully provide an
        interface for enquires to be made to projects and relevant information be shown. Prior to our user acceptance
        testing the experience wasnt as easy for using the chatbot interface as there was no guidance on the kinds
        of messages that the chatbot could respond to, however on development we were able to add a help section
        which opened the gates to a more full utilisation of our chatbot. The user experience in the end was overall
        a pleasant one.</p>
        <p>Functionality</p>
        <p class="text-black-50">All core functionality has been completed to a high standard. The chatbot and parser are fully functional as
        per requirements.</p>
        <p>Stability</p>
        <p class="text-black-50">Our chatbot can be considered to have good stability as there is a consistent output
        for a given input. The AI behind the chatbot can evolve however so it could be considered to be unstable as
        some inputs could produce different outputs as the model is trained further. Such instability will not be
        considered negatively, but a positive outcome for the future of the project. </p>
        <p>Efficiency</p>
        <p class="text-black-50">Our chatbot can be considered to be extremely efficient as a single message can
        provide the user with plentiful options and information relevant to their query. Further information is
        also easy to access and very quick to do, which aids the efficiency of our chatbot. Our IXN miner is efficient
        as insertion of projects is quick and comprehensive, as well as updating of projects, as our GUI allows for
        quick and simple data entry with near instant response.</p>
        <p>Compatibility</p>
        <p class="text-black-50">Our project is compatible with all operating systems, our chatbot is ran on browser
        and has been tested on various browsers and hardwares and works across all platforms with no performance deficit.
        No alteration is required for our project to be ran on any operating system / hardware.</p>
        <p>Maintainability</p>
        <p class="text-black-50">Our code is commented and documented which adds to its maintainability. Our code is also
        very modular and so is extendable if requirements change over time. The monthly cost of hosting our national
        database is currently £46.43, in the long run this may increase depending on how vast the database expands.</p>
        <p>Project management</p>
        <p class="text-black-50">Adnan has been the team leader of our project and has provided excelent management for
        the work which we have completed. He has communicated efficiently with clients and gathered requirements in a
        timely manner. Rajesh and Adnan kept eachother updated continuously for updates within the project, with the
        additional use of trello to keep track of milestones. Overall the project management was excellent as we have
        completed all requirements. </p>

        <p></p>
        <h2 class="text-black mb-4">Future work</h2>
        <p class="text-black-50">If we had more time for the project we hope to be able to fix the existing bugs, in
        particular the welcome card so that other organisations might be able to swap out the image within the welcome
        card to replace with their own for their own locally hosted chatbots.</p>
        <p class="text-black-50">We also hope to further train our AI so that it can recognise a wider array of messages
        which will come with time when our chatbot is used by practitioners and others in our target audience.</p>
        <p class="text-black-50">Further development can be guided by changes in requirements over time as well as further
        user feedback as our user base grows over time</p>
        <p class="text-black-50">In the future we would hope to integrate Google Maps API with our chatbot in order to
        be able to geographically locate where projects are taking place, unfortunately we were not able to complete
        this as we had reduced capability as one of our members of our team was no longer able to take part in the project.</p>
